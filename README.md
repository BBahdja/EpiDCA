EpiDCA: Adaptation and implementation of the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) for event-based epidemiological surveillance

This is part of my PhD thesis work (contains the source code, and two test data sets). We have adapted the Dendritic Cells Algorithm (Created by Julie Greensmith on 27/03/2008) to apply it in a context of event-based surveillance. Here is an extract from the written part:

"To timely detect outbreak events, various epidemiological surveillance strategies are adopted and overwhelming health-related data are available. 
we propose an unsupervised approach that allows us to combine both epidemiological data and risk factors related to the onset diseases. This method, called EpiDCA, is applied to event-based surveillance systems, and aims to enhance their capacities in terms of classification and early detection.

EpiDCA is an adaptation of the DCA, inspired by the danger theory.
we also propose a new strategy that is based on the spatio-temporal aspect of the antigens (items to classify) in the detection phase.".
